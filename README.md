# Laras-s-thing
Hello
Apa kabar 
....I've been summoned in this world for an important mission. Born in a big city of Indonesia and grew up in a horrendous place of Cibubur. Used to be make fun of my living area, Depok. A place of the first covid case in Indonesia, tons of cases of murderer and burgler, a town with a mayor that makes his own song that was played in the traffic lights to reduce stress of the Depok people and all the viral ghost cases site. Currently living in an completely different part of the world and just chilling as a first year graphic student. Excited to rule over this whole computation unit.
